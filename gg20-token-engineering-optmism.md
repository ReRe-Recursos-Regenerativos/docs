## What specific problem(s) do you seek to solve with this grant, and how will you know whether you have accomplished your goal(s)?
With the implementation of the Common Pool of Shareable Resources (CPoSR) project, our primary aim is to address the challenge of **equitable resource distribution** within the ecosystem.
Specifically, we seek to **solve the problem of unequal access to resources**, which often hinders the development of innovative and impactful projects.

It´s more like challenges than problems per se .... that said , more even than the grant itself, the opportunity to have this type of proximity with TEC seems that " perfect storm " kind of scenario  ! well, in what sense right ? you guys would ask ... for starters ReRe ´s CPoSR (common pool of shareable resources) is based on IRL P2P experiential interactive dynamics to perceive abundance logic as something already culturally  embedded in the very nature of our social species fabric ( and by extension so are projects in general if perceived as opensource organisms ) ...  so for this grant round specifically we´re seeking to explore and accomplish how the sharing from peers and projects of different kinds of resources ( tangigle / intagible ) through the lenses of what is considered by each one as abundant , empathic or conditioned for any given CPoSR  can relate with greenpill`s network 08 forms of capital ( material, financial, living, intellectual, experiential, spiritual and cultural ) to not only establish what kind of token would have to be engineered for each one in order to represent an wide range of different kinds of resources but also an ReFi holistic tokenomics framework around it.

## Describe how your project contributes to token engineering and why it is a valuable public good.
Considering the type of cyber cultural primitives that ReRe as an web3 cultural regenerative protocol seeks to blueprint in the emergent web3 cyberspace , it has the potential to contribute in various ways, such as for instance ....  co-creating an tokenomics framework based on nature´s abundance logic interactive mutual resources accessing dynamics that is not inherently transactional but relational ; or even blueprinting through ReRe´s CPoSR  a type of ReFi public good that has the capability to deal with all sorts of IRL complex societal contexts through an truly all wide 08 forms of capital regenerative framework ; not counting what ReRe has already been doing experimeting with web2 / web2-web3 / web3 projects: co-create an P2P interactive way re-conceptualize web2 " silicon valley " startup culture very much based in competitive zero-sum games and extremely team oriented through the lenses of organizational-organic (O2) frameworks based on the co-creation of different types of  commonships through CPoSR and driven by abundance logic ...

## How did you hear about the Token Engineering Grants Program?
We have seen the Token Engineering Grants Program at Gitcoin Explorer website.

## Would you agree to participate in a follow-up survey approximately 8 weeks after the grant round to assess the impact of the funding on your project?

**Yes**


## Anything else you'd like to share about your project, previous work, or other project affiliations? Anything you'd like to add that has not been covered?
Certainly ! We would start by saying that this specific project - co-create a ReFi holistic tokenomics framework based on the 08 forms of capital of greenpill network for CPoSR`s abundance logic P2P interactive dynamics - has as antecedent at least 07 years of commons-driven intense explorations with hundreds of people through different projects and opensource initiatives where the more recent one is related to ReRe´s value proposal as an web3 cultural regenerative protocol .... such as for instance:
