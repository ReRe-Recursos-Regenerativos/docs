# AN NEW WEB CYBER CULTURE IS POSSIBLE: **from user-centric web2 hyperconsumerism to web3 regenerative co-creator prosumism**

## **In the algorithmic cybernetics of web2 we are raw material, product & user** ...

## **surely with the current web3 we stop being products once we became owners of our own data but that´s not enough, web cyber sovereignty is needed too**...

## In this emergent context, **ReRe** as an *cultural web3 regenerative protocol* aims to co-create *IRL cyber cultural primitives* that currently do not exist on the **web3** space, linked to paradigms that gives new meanings to what wealth should already be massively considered in this collapsing third decade of the 21th century, the way of generating and as well as how to regeneratively endeavour`s it

# **encouraging interactive P2P coordination in between, for and within people & projects**

## via an **P2P co-creative netweaving flow** of activities, events and all sorts of disruptive experiences through playful, reflective & relational open learning journeys

## that generates different **proofs of humanization** that each person and/or project carries out in their own time ...

## **aiming to slow down to accelerate**, 
*catalyzing critical shifts in perception*

## such as if we´re complex beings abundance is naturally embedded in our own existence (*not artifial scarcity*) therefore projects, for instances, can literally be reframed as conceptual proofs of living interconnected organisms not stand alone zero-sum organizations ...

# **COMMON POOLS OF SHAREABLE RESOURCES**

## searching for new indexes for network shared value and providing real abundance experiences for each person/project and fostering a culture of mutual availability-access to all types of resources

## for the co-realization of any activity, from decentralized events such as **primavera regenerativa** in the BR spring of **2022** or **feijoada SAFA** in the BR summer of **2023**; to the interweaving of benefits via **NFT** of actions such as the **feijão AMIGO**  from [agroforestDAO](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/0xe9459565709c5e856ffbc3cc8715824945d92de7/8) , or for the projects themselves that are going through the dynamics of ReRe`s **critical mapping** to spark the ignition for their own *common pools of shareable resources*

## **where each shared resource is recognized** as **proof of abundance** and registered by the projects in ethereum **ReFi** ecosystem through the interface that **ReRe** has with [greenpill BR](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/0xe9459565709c5e856ffbc3cc8715824945d92de7/13)

## but that´s only the very first step towards the co-evolution of ReRe CPSR (Common Pool of Shareable Resources) as an new IRL cyber cultural primitive for the regenerative web3 space once now we aim to transform it in an DAPP that bridges ReRe abundance logic wealth generator to [Gregory´s Landua](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/the-donut-economy-x-8-forms-of-capital/10079) 08 forms of capital that inspired Kevin`s Owocki greenpill book and further more the ongong co-creation of the [greenpill network](https://greenpill.network/) 



## *for this year ReRe will netweave interfaces with differents types of DLTs / DAG :  holochain, internet computer, hashgraph* ....

## thus creating an entire regenerative P2P network dynamic, undertaking projects on the web3 based on the logic of abundance and commonship culture 

## **resulting in a capacity for impact & resilience** 
that differs greatly from the typical startup, since the project, when undertaken in an intertwined network and onchain, in addition to being backed by all types of **collective intelligence**, will be giving life to new regenerative **web3 blueprints** of **wealth generation**.

# **ReRe in an nutshell** ?

## **more-than-human interface with AI**
## **abundance as daily practice**
## **societal tissue regeneration**
## **commonship as a source code for resources mutual access**
## **trustfullness instead of trustless**
