**Common Pool of Shareable Resources**

A common pool of shareable resources solves several problems, including:

1. **Equal Access:** It allows participants to access financial resources and services that would otherwise be inaccessible to them.

2. **Collaboration and Cooperation:** It facilitates collaboration among community members, promoting cooperation and mutual support.

3. **Resource Efficiency:** It avoids duplication of efforts and resources, maximizing the efficient use of available resources.

4. **Cost Reduction:** It enables participants to share the costs of resources and services, thereby reducing individual costs for each member.

5. **Innovation and Creativity:** It stimulates innovation and creativity by providing an environment where participants can experiment and collaborate on new ideas and projects.

Additionally, this common pool will function as an exchange of tokens representing the eight forms of capital, and interactions within the community will be registered with the respective tokens representing each form of capital. These tokens will include:

1. **Financial Capital**
2. **Natural Capital**
3. **Social Capital**
4. **Cultural Capital**
5. **Human Capital**
6. **Intellectual Capital**
7. **Spiritual Capital**
8. **Built Capital**

Through this tokenization, the community can quantify and track their contributions and impacts across different dimensions of capital, fostering transparency and accountability.

In summary, the common pool of shareable resources helps promote equality, collaboration, and efficiency, while also fostering innovation and creativity within the community.
