**Common Pool of Shared Resources**

A common pool of shared resources solves several problems, including:

1. **Equal Access:** It allows participants to access financial resources and services that would otherwise be inaccessible to them.

2. **Collaboration and Cooperation:** It facilitates collaboration among community members, promoting cooperation and mutual support.

3. **Resource Efficiency:** It avoids duplication of efforts and resources, maximizing the efficient use of available resources.

4. **Cost Reduction:** It enables participants to share the costs of resources and services, thereby reducing individual costs for each member.

5. **Innovation and Creativity:** It stimulates innovation and creativity by providing an environment where participants can experiment and collaborate on new ideas and projects.

In summary, the common pool of shared resources helps promote equality, collaboration, and efficiency, while also fostering innovation and creativity within the community.
